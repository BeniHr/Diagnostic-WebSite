                <b><span>Your ideal car is not always near you</span></b><br>
                Can't find the perfect car? Perfect specs? The perfect color? It may not be available locally. As our partner, we open up the European market for you. We offer a simple, convenient and secure way to purchase a vehicle remotely, even from another country. We have agents all over Europe. You can find the car of your dreams in the comfort of your home.
<br><br><br>

                <b><span>You don’t know the condition of the vehicle</span></b><br>
                How do you determine the condition of the vehicle, if everything is in order or if it has been damaged and repaired? Even the most honest car dealer may not have the time to thoroughly inspect every car. You can send an InspectWise agent to the seller's location. Our reports are "super cool", thorough and easy to read. Any defects found will help negotiate the right price. You can avoid post-sale consumer disputes because you can have peace of mind knowing what you've purchased.

                <b><span>It can be hard to protect yourself against fraud</span></b><br>
                With two cars being stolen in Europe every minute, knowing your desired car is not stolen or cloned can be challenging. Questions such as, “Does the seller have the right to sell this car?” or “Have these documents been fabricated?” are legitimate because professional criminals are  more skilled now than ever. With online being their favourite place to scam victims, you could be one of their next targets.                 <br>
