                <h2>ANCEL FX2000</h2>
              <p>This scan tool provides tons of great features for a fraction of the cost of some of the more expensive scan tool models out there. The tradeoff is that it doesn’t cover as many vehicles.

                While it covers any post-1996 US-made vehicle, it only covers vehicles produced after 2002 from the EU and 2005 from Asian countries. It does support eight different languages, and if you’re only using it on newer vehicles, it will do everything you could want and more.
            <br><br>
            It reads engine, ABS, SRS, and PCM codes and lives streams data from each of these symptoms to help you troubleshoot the problem. Additionally, it can run emission tests on your vehicle to help you pass smog or emission tests.

Not only do you get a great deal on the scan tool up front, but with free lifetime updates, they aren’t nickel and diming you down the road either.
                <br><br>
                While the Ancel FX2000 only works on some vehicles after 1996, it will still read basic engine codes for any vehicle with an OBD2 system. However, you will not be able to utilize live data streaming or other advanced features.

                <h2> Autel MaxiCOM MK908 Bi-Directional</h2>

                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, it gives you the ability to live stream data from various sensors and freeze-frame that data for easier troubleshooting.

The Autel MaxiCOM MK908 works wirelessly from up to 755 feet away. Whether you’re working on the other side of the shop or in the driver’s seat, this scan tool can handle it.

                    Finally, like all Autel scan tools, this one comes with a 1-year warranty, but you will need to purchase yearly updates to keep this scan tool up to date with all the newest vehicles.
